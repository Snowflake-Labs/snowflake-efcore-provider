# Entity Framework Core Provider for Snowflake

The Snowflake Developer Platform team has made the decision to conclude the Private Preview (PrPr) programs for both the Entity Framework (a .NET-based ORM) and Hibernate (a Java-based ORM). These ORMs will also not be moving forward to Public Preview (PuPr) or General Availability (GA). However, they will be made available in Snowflake-Labs so that customers can utilize the work weâ€™ve done up until this point.

Reasoning
While this decision was not made lightly, the team believes it is in the best interest of Snowflake to focus on strengthening and enhancing its core capabilities.

Immediate Actions
Effective immediately, active development of the Entity Framework and Hibernate ORMs has ceased. Additionally, any development work on other requested ORMs has been paused indefinitely.

Future Plans
While active development has stopped, the work that has been completed will not be lost. On May 5, 2025, repositories for both the Entity Framework and Hibernate ORMs will be made available on Snowflake-Labs. However, these repositories will be in maintenance mode only.

Key Points About Snowflake-Labs Repositories
The feature set for both ORMs will be limited to the functionality that was validated during the PrPr phase.
These ORMs will no longer be actively developed.
Critical security issues will be patched if they are reported or detected.
Official Snowflake Support will not be provided.
Detailed documentation will be available within the repositories.
The repositories will not be actively monitored.

This is the open-source EF Core provider for Snowflake. It enables seamless interaction with Snowflake using Microsoft's widely-used .NET Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). 
With this provider, you can write queries using familiar LINQ syntax and take advantage of the powerful features of Entity Framework Core in your Snowflake projects.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To install the Snowflake EF Core provider, use the following command in your .NET project:

```bash
dotnet add package Snowflake.EntityFrameworkCore
```

### Usage
The provider integrates smoothly with Entity Framework Core, making it feel like any other EF Core provider. Here's a quick example to get started:
```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Snowflake.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class MyEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class SampleDbContext : DbContext
{
    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSnowflake(
            "account=<your_account>;host=<your_host>;password=<your_password>;role=<your_role>;schema=<your_schema>;user=<your_user>;warehouse=<your_warehouse>;");
    }

    public DbSet<MyEntity> MyEntities { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using var context = new SampleDbContext();
        context.MyEntities.Add(new MyEntity { Id = 1, Name = "Sample Entity" });
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

## Development

### Running Tests
The project includes two test solutions:

- **Unit Tests**: Located in the `EFCore.Tests` project.
- **Functional Tests**: Located in the `Snowflake.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests` project.

#### Prerequisites
To run the tests, you need to create a `parameters.json` file for each test project.

Should be created in the following locations:
1. `.../EFCore.Tests/parameters.json`
2. `.../tests/Snowflake.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests/parameters.json`

The file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "testconnection": {
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_HOST": "your_host",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_USER": "your_user",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_PASSWORD": "your_password",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ACCOUNT": "your_account",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_WAREHOUSE": "your_warehouse",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_DATABASE": "your_database",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_SCHEMA": "your_schema",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ROLE": "your_role"
  }
}

```
#### Steps to Run Tests
1. Create a `parameters.json` file in the root directory of each test project using the structure provided above.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed and your Snowflake test account is configured correctly.
3. Run the tests using your preferred test runner (e.g., Rider Test Explorer or the `dotnet test` CLI).

```bash
dotnet test EFCore.Tests
dotnet test Snowflake.EntityFrameworkCore.FunctionalTests
```
